# Tools for A + B work (A are Brain results, B are LogPPT result)

## Steps to reproduce

1. To merge the parsed results of Brain & LogPPT[^1], use 

```bash
python merge.py result_Brain_2k result_LogPPT_2k result_brain-logpptA
```

2. For evaluation, run 

```bach
python eval.py -otc --parsed_file result_brain-logppt --alg brain-logppt
```

## Results

The results of the evaluation are located in the `result` directory. Check `brain-logppt_2k_complex_0_frequent_0.csv`.

A brief summary is (for Loghub-2.0 2k datasets):

| Alg.           | Average GA | Average PA | Average FGA | Average FTA |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Brain          | **0.984**   | 0.322       | 0.931        | 0.337        |
| LogPPT         | 0.746       | 0.715       | 0.856        | 0.629        |
| Brain + LogPPT | 0.976       | **0.728**   | **0.967**    | **0.689**    |

[^1]: We note the results for LogPPT are generated by a *flawed* version of it, for this version, we turn off the trick of *label word*.
