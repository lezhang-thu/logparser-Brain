The original log data and templates are from Loghub, and we also include the revised template files in [the Artifact for "Guidelines for Assessing the Accuracy of Log Message Template Identification Techniques"](https://figshare.com/articles/software/Artifact_for_Guidelines_for_Assessing_the_Accuracy_of_Log_Message_Template_Identification_Techniques_/18858332).
 
# Loghub

Loghub maintains a collection of system logs, which are freely accessible for AI-driven log analytics research. Some of the logs are production data released from previous studies, while some others are collected from real systems in our lab environment. Wherever possible, the logs are NOT sanitized, anonymized or modified in any way. These log datasets are freely available for research or academic work.

ðŸ¤— We proudly announce that the loghub datasets have attained total <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1144100"><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?&url=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/logpai/loghub@zenodo/downloads.json&labelColor=1AE&color=DDEEFF&style=flat&label=Downloads"></a> by more than [**450 organizations**](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/wiki/Loghub-download-list) from both industry and academia.
